Overview of the Abbott command system:

Plugins derive from the CommandPluginSuperclass class below. This is a
derivative of the BotPlugin class and supports all the normal bot plugins, but
adds some methods and provides easy mechanism for defining "commands".

This command plugin superclass is currently written specifically for the IRC
plugin.

Commands registered by command plugins are recognized in one of three ways.
First, if a user prefixes the command with the bot's name, followed by a colon.
e.g. "abbott: commandname"
Second: if a prefix is defined for that command. Example: if the prefix "." is
used, then the line ".commandname" is recognized.
Third: a global prefix can be defined, which works the same way as above.

Commands can be grouped, in which case you define subcommands. They are treated
the same way, but are an easy way of not filling up the namespace and for
organizing commands.
e.g. "abbott: groupname commandname argument1 argument2"

Commands are declared by calling the method self.install_command in a plugin's
start() method. See the docstring for _CommandGroup.install_command() for
information on its arguments.

Command groups are declared by calling self.install_cmdgroup() in a plugin's
start() method. See the docstring for the
CommandPluginSuperclass.install_cmdgroup() method for information on its
arguments and how to use command groups.

This command framework has a few nice features: easily defined commands with
flexible argument parsing with regular expressions, an integrated help system,
and automatic permission checking.

        cmdname is the name of the command, used in command listing and usage
        text

        callback is the callable to call when the command is invoked. It takes
        two arguments: the Event object from the request, and a re.Match object
        from the cmdmatch parameter.

        deniedcallback is called if access was denied for the current user. If
        False is returned, the normal error handling (replying with a message)
        is activated. If True is returned, we assume that it was "handled" and
        no further action is taken. The signature is the same as for the
        callback.

        cmdmatch, if specified, is a regular expression string specifying how
        to match just the command name (not the arguments). If it is not
        specified, the cmdname string is used to match the command. It should
        not have any capturing parenthesis since this will be concatenated with
        the argument matching regular expression.

        cmdusage, if specified, is the usage text for the command's argumetns.
        For example, if the command takes two requried arguments and one
        optional argument, this should be set to something like "<arg1> <arg2>
        [arg3]"

        argmatch is a regular expression string that matches the arguments of
        this command. The resulting match object is passed in to the callback.
        If not specified, the command takes no arguments. You probably want to
        put a $ at the end of this if given, otherwise any trailing string will
        still match.

        permission, if given, is the permission required for a user to execute
        this command. If not given, permission is taken from the command group.

        prefix is an additional prefix that may be given to have the bot
        recognize a command. For example, a "ban" command may want to specify a
        prefix of "." so the standard ban command works, even if "." isn't a
        normal command trigger for this bot.

        helptext, if given, is displayed after the usage in help messages as a
        short one-line description of this command.
