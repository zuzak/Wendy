About the Abbott event system:

Events are instances of the Event class below. Each event has a name, which is
typically a string with dot separators. The convention is that events should be
hierarchical, like domain.action, such as irc.on_privmsg (which is fired on
receiving a PRIVMSG command from the IRC server.)

Event objects carry an arbitrary (or rather, event-defined) set of attributes.

Each BotPlugin object can register to be notified when an event is emitted by
any other plugin. Plugins can register listeners on a particular event name, or
glob event names such as irc.* or irc.on_*

Globs do not transcend dots, so you must do something like *.* to receive all
events.

There are two ways to register an event: as a normal listener, or as a
middleware listener. There are two differences: all middleware listeners are
called before normal listeners, and middleware listeners have an opportunity to
edit the event arbitrarily (add or change attributes) or destroy the event (in
which case no other handlers will be called.

This system allows for things like an auth plugin which inserts authentication
information into the event for use by other plugins. It's perfectly fine to
insert callback functions as attributes on the event too, not just values. (See
the auth.Auth plugin)

Aside from events, there is another mechanism meant for inter-plugin
communication. One plugin can send a "request" that another plugin perfrom some
action and return some result. A plugin must register that it provides a
particular request by calling its .transport.provides_request(request_name,
self) method. The request names are of a separate namespace as events, and
globbing is not allowed; each request must be specifically declared. When a
request comes in, the plugin's incoming_request() method is called. The first
argument is the request name.  The rest are *args, **kwargs. It is expected to
return a deferred object. To issue a request, call transport.send_request()
with the request name and the appropriate arguments.

Other notes about requests: only one plugin may provide a request handler for a
particular request name. If more than one handler tries to provide a particular
request, the behavior is undefined.
