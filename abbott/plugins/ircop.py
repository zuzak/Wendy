IRC OP-related plugins. This is meant to replace the old admin.* plugins with a
new, cleaned-up architecture.

Outline of this module:
* Connector plugins that interface with a method of performing IRC operator
  operations. They expose one method per operation (quiet, deop, etc)
  - Chanserv connector: sends requests to chanserv
  - Weechat connector: sends requests to chanserv via a local weechat fifo

  These plugins should be relatively lightweight. These plugins don't have any
  return value, and never error. Some connectors may have no way of detecting
  if it didn't work, so detection of whether the request worked must happen at
  a higher level.

* The OpProvider plugin provides a unified interface to OP functions. It takes
  care of choosing which connector to use (or sending a mode request directly
  to the irc plugin itself) depending on the channel, the command, the
  current OP status of the bot, and the plugin's configuration.

  Specific features of this plugin:
  - exposes to other plugins one function per operation: op, deop, voice,
    devoice, quiet, unquiet, ban, unban, kick, and set topic
  - keeps track of what it can do in which channels and how. For example, some
    channels it may can do everything through chanserv, but others it may can
    only OP itself with chanserv and must do everything else itself.
  - if it has a method of acquiring OP, it will automatically de-op itself when
    it's not needed.
  - provides a become_op() function for other plugins to force it to hold OP
    for a while
  - Submits multiple mode requests in batch, and submits multiple operations in
    one op session before deopping, if possible

    one of: op, deop, voice, devoice, quiet, unquiet, ban, unban, kick, topic.
    All take a first parameter: channel. All except topic take a second
    parameter: a hostmask or nick.

    Also provides ircop.become_op which takes two parameters: a channel name
    and a duration, in seconds. When called, the bot will attempt to acquire op
    status in the given channel and  hold it for (at least) the given duration.

    Each request returns a deferred that will callback when the operation
    succeeds. The deferred may errback with an OpFailed error if the operation
    required the bot gain OP but OP could not be acquired.

    The plugin will automatically deop itself after performing operations if
    the config defines a way to gain OP.

    Requests are internally buffered and batched so that several simultaneous
    requests will all be submitted with one OP+DEOP cycle. For this to work,
    callers should submit all requests before waiting for any of them to
    callback/errback.

    (If you wait for each submitted operation, then you end up waiting for each
    one to be completely processed before the next one, forcing each operation
    to re-op and process in individual batches. If the API were changed so that
    requests return immediately, this would make the batching more fool-proof
    for callers, but then the caller couldn't be informed of errors in
    acquiring OP. Therefore, this burden must be placed on the caller.)
