"""

The auth module provides the Auth plugin, which handles authorization of irc
users. It identifies irc users by the response code 330 from a whois, commonly
used to supply the username the user is logged in with.

The plugin hooks incoming irc events and adds a function to the event object:
has_permission(). This function takes two parameters: a permission string, and
a channel, and returns a deferred which fires with a boolean value indicating
if the user that initiated the event has that permission in that channel or
not. (if channel is irrelevant for the permission, it should be None,
indicating a global permission)

Permission strings are heirarchical strings delimited by dots. If a user has a
permission, they also have all sub-permissions of that permission. For example,
if a user has permission "foo.bar", these calls return true:
    has_permission("foo.bar")
    has_permission("foo.bar.baz")

Groups are also implemented and are fairly simple. Group names start with a %,
and groups are assigned permissions just the same as users.  Users are then
assigned to groups, and the users inherit all the permissions of that group, as
well as their individually assigned permissions. Pretty standard.

For example, a group has permission irc.op, then all users of that group are
granted irc.op. Groups are assigned permissions, and users are assigned
membership in a group.

Groups do not cascade. You cannot assign a group to another group.

Permission commands fall under the !permission command. Group commands are
under the !group command. Most permission manipulation commands require the
permission auth.edit.  The group manipulation commands are different. They
require the auth.edit.group.<groupname> permission (which is auto granted if
you have auth.edit). This is so you can grant permission to edit a specific
group, while not requiring having access to edit all groups or all permissions.

    If auth_perm is some permission required by a command, and user_perm is
    some permission that a user has, this function returns True if user_perm
    grants access to auth_perm

    Permission strings are hierarchical. Granting admin will grant admin,
    admin.op1, admin.op2, etc.

    Simple globs are supported, and do not transcend dots.  Granting
    admin.*.foo will allow admin.bar.foo and admin.baz.foo, but not
    admin.bar.baz.foo

    Globs at the end of permissions match as expected from the above rules.

    NOT 'admin' by itself!)
